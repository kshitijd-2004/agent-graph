"Rel objects" for related fields.

"Rel objects" (for lack of a better name) carry information about the relation
modeled by a related field and provide some utility functions. They're stored
in the ``remote_field`` attribute of the field.

They also act as reverse fields for the purposes of the Meta API because
they're the closest concept currently available.

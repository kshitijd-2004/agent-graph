def fowlkes_mallows_score(labels_true, labels_pred, sparse=False):
    """Measure the similarity of two clusterings of a set of points.

    The Fowlkes-Mallows index (FMI) is defined as the geometric mean between of
    the precision and recall::

        FMI = TP / sqrt((TP + FP) * (TP + FN))

    Where ``TP`` is the number of **True Positive** (i.e. the number of pair of
    points that belongs in the same clusters in both ``labels_true`` and
    ``labels_pred``), ``FP`` is the number of **False Positive** (i.e. the
    number of pair of points that belongs in the same clusters in
    ``labels_true`` and not in ``labels_pred``) and ``FN`` is the number of
    **False Negative** (i.e the number of pair of points that belongs in the
    same clusters in ``labels_pred`` and not in ``labels_True``).

    The score ranges from 0 to 1. A high value indicates a good similarity
    between two clusters.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <fowlkes_mallows_scores>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_true : int array, shape = (``n_samples``,)
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    labels_pred : array, shape = (``n_samples``, )
        A clustering of the data into disjoint subsets.

    sparse : bool
        Compute contingency matrix internally with sparse matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    score : float
       The resulting Fowlkes-Mallows score.

    Examples
    --------

    Perfect labelings are both homogeneous and complete, hence have
    score 1.0::

      >>> from sklearn.metrics.cluster import fowlkes_mallows_score
      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1, 1])
      1.0
      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0])
      1.0

    If classes members are completely split across different clusters,
    the assignment is totally random, hence the FMI is null::

      >>> fowlkes_mallows_score([0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3])
      0.0
